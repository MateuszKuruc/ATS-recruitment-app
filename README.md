# ATS-recruitment-app

The goal is to develop full fledged Applicant Tracking System (ATS) app for recruiters. This is a full stack app based on JavaScript and related tools:

- React for frontend
- Redux for state management
- NodeJS + Express for backend
- MongoDB as a non relational database
- Token authentication (JWT) for login
- Material UI for design layer
- Fly.io for hosting the whole app

The app allows a recruiter to better organise the recruitment process and make it more transparent. Functionalities:

- add candidate with the basic, universally used, data (name, e-mail, phone nubmer, experience, field, city, notice period etc.)
- upload and download candidate's CV
- delete candidate's records
- update candidate's profile (e.g. when their contact details or work experience change)
- sort candidates by the field of their specialisation (e.g. main programming lanugage/tool), location or years of experience
