        This short guide was written with the aim of helping you successfully
        navigate the application and make the best use of it. ATS apps are
        becoming increasingly widespread and currently most, if not all,
        recruitment agencies and internal recruitment teams use it, but the

        recruitment.

      <p>
        Let us make clear how such systems are built and what their
        functionalities are, so you can improve your recruiting experience and
        keep track of the candidates' pipeline that you are working on.
