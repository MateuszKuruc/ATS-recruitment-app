  This short guide was written with the aim of helping you successfully
  navigate the application and make the best use of it. ATS apps are
  becoming increasingly widespread and currently most, if not all,
  recruitment agencies and internal recruitment teams use it, but the
  concept of ATS is still foreign to most people outside of career in
  recruitment.
</p>
<p>
  Let us make clear how such systems are built and what their
  functionalities are, so you can improve your recruiting experience and
  keep track of the candidates' pipeline that you are working on.
</p>
<h2>What are advantages of using ATS?</h2>
<p>
  First of all, ATS is a way of keeping all the important details
  regarding candidates in one place. It eliminates the need to employ
  additional separate trackers (e.g. in Excel), which makes it a very
  universal tool.
</p>

<div>
  <p>Some of the funcionalities include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding, removing and editing candidate profiles</li>
    <li>Uploading resumes and other related documents to a profile</li>
    <li>
      Tracking recruitment process stages to quickly gather information on
      the given candidate's progress in terms of hiring
    </li>
    <li>
      Acting as a database of candidates for the future reference. If the
      candidate has been rejected from one process, they could still be a
      perfect match for the future recruitments - ATS allows easier access
      to such individuals
    </li>
  </ul>
